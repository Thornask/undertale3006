				Undertale is a role-playing game that utilizes many genre mechanics, mechanics, albeit differently.
				It also has a very instresting concept behind the game: The Friendly RPG where <yellow>NOBODY</yellow> has to <red>DIE</red>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The overworld mostly consists of puzzles that the player must solve to progress.
				Battles can also be seen as puzzles, as it can require the right set of <yellow>ACTs</yellow> to resolve the fight peacefully.
				However, if the player decides to kill every monster they can find, many puzzles are disabled.
				In this situation, the player is required to grind encounters to progress the game.
				Unlike traditional RPGs, grinding, backtracking, and the few sidequests are all optional.
			</p>
			<p>
				Undertale features witty and humorous dialogue, with occasional fourth wall breaks.
				The dialogue and locations can be drastically altered based on the player's actions.
				This ranges from minor options, killing and sparing monsters, and the <rainbow><b>SAVE</b></rainbow> feature.
				For the latter, almost every major character possesses meta-knowledge.
				If the player quits or resets the game, these characters comment on the player's past action,
				or have a sense of familiarity from past playthroughs.
